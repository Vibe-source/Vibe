defmodule Vibe.AI.MCP do
  @moduledoc """
  Entry point for Model Context Protocol support.

  An agent's MCP servers are declared per integration (see `MCP.Registry`), so
  nothing here is specific to any one product: point an agent at any MCP
  server and its tools appear in that agent's tool list with real JSON
  Schemas, in every surface the agent runs in — DM, group, channel, or voice.

  Two things make this more than a generic RPC bridge:

    * **Discovery.** Tools arrive with schemas, so the model fills arguments
      instead of guessing at a prose description of an action name.
    * **Files.** A tool that returns bytes gets those bytes delivered to the
      user as an attachment, while the model sees one line of text. That is
      what makes "send me the invoice for customer X" possible at all.

  Runs one namespaced MCP tool on behalf of an agent, in a specific chat.

  Authorization is **chat-scoped, not requester-scoped**. Owner-only would be
  wrong in both directions: it would break the whole point of adding your
  agent to a group (every teammate's request would be refused), and it would
  wrongly imply that identity alone is the grant. What actually authorizes an
  MCP call is that the owner enabled `call_mcp_tool` on this agent *and*
  attached it to this chat — `Chat.effective_agent_policy/3` is the single
  place that decides both.

  The check is repeated here even though the tool list was already scoped
  when it was built: the list is a hint to the model, and a model can be
  talked into calling a name it should not have. The gate that matters is the
  one at execution.
