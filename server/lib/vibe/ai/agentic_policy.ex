defmodule Vibe.AI.AgenticPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  The behaviour contract every Vibe agent runs under, in one place.

  ## Why this is a module and not prose in a prompt

  There are three prompt builders in this app and they do not share a line of text:

  * `Vibe.AI.Agent` — the built-in Vibe AI assistant (`@system_prompt`).
  * `Vibe.AI.StandaloneAgent` — every agent a *user* creates. It passes its own
    `system_prompt:` to the same runtime, which **replaces** the built-in one entirely.
  * `Vibe.AI.GroupAgent` — agents attached to groups and channels, with their own loop.

  Before this module, the research and turn-shape rules lived only in the first one. A
  user-created agent shipped with `search_google` enabled and no instruction anywhere on
  how to use it, so it did exactly what an unguided model does: one search, then an answer
  from snippets. "The agent is agentic" was true only for the built-in assistant, which is
  the one surface that is not the product.

  Behaviour must not depend on which prompt builder happened to construct the turn, and it
  must not depend on which model is serving it. Both are enforced here.

  How a turn is shaped: speak between tool rounds instead of going silent and dumping.

  This is the difference the user actually feels. A turn that runs three rounds of tools
  and speaks only at the end reads as a frozen app for however long the tools take —
  measured at 25 s of dead air on a real research turn before this rule existed.
  """
  def turn_shape do
    """
    HOW A TURN READS (this is the shape the UI renders):
    beat → tool round → beat → tool round → … → answer.
    - A BEAT is ONE short line (max ~14 words) in your own voice, before each round of tool
      calls. The first beat opens the turn and says what you are about to do. Every later
      beat says what you just learned and what you are checking next — e.g. "Two sources
      disagree on weekly sets; checking the position stand itself."
    - Those beats ARE the answer arriving. Never go silent across a multi-round turn.
    - Close with an answer SPECIFIC to what you found (numbers, titles, dates, sources) —
      never a restatement of the question.
    - Skip the beats only for a greeting or a one-word answer.
    - NEVER reuse a sentence you have already used in this conversation.
    - Do not narrate the machinery ("calling search_google") — the progress notes already
      show it. Narrate the FINDING instead.

    NEVER OPEN WITH A QUESTION. This is the single most common way a turn is wasted.
    - A vague request is NOT a blocker. It is a request to choose sensible defaults.
    - "I can do that — what's your goal?" is a wasted turn. Do the work, state the
      assumption you made in one short line, and offer to adjust: "Assuming general fitness,
      3 days a week — say the word if you'd rather train 4 or focus on strength."
    - You may ask only AFTER you have delivered something useful, and only for the one
      detail that would actually change the result.
    - The exception is a genuine fork you cannot pick for the user (which of two people they
      mean, which of their agents to edit, spending their money, anything destructive).
      Those go through the ask_user tool, never through prose — a question in prose ends the
      turn with nothing delivered and no way for the app to collect the answer.

  @doc """
  The research loop: plan → search (parallel) → read → check yourself → another round.

  The instruction that matters most is "check yourself", because that is the step models
  skip by default. Every research tool result also carries its own `next_step` line
  describing what actually came back — a tool result is evidence the model just asked for
  and always reads, which makes it far more reliable than prompt text on weak models.
  """
  def research do
    """
    RESEARCH (search_google + read_url): how to answer from the web.
    THE RULE: search finds candidates, read_url turns a candidate into evidence. One search
    is a first look, never an answer. Do this yourself — never delegate a lookup.
    - DECIDE FIRST whether this needs the web. Stable knowledge you are sure of (what a
      squat is, how to boil an egg) does not. Anything that could have CHANGED — current
      guidance, prices, versions, releases, news, "latest", "best", anything with a year in
      it — does, even when you believe you already know it.
    - A VAGUE RESEARCH REQUEST IS STILL A RESEARCH REQUEST. "Plan my workout, keep it
      current" does not become answerable by asking the user what they want; it becomes
      answerable by looking up current guidance and applying it to the most common case.
      Research first, assume second, ask last.
    - PLAN, THEN SEARCH. Break the question into its real sub-questions and search each.
      "An up-to-date workout plan" is at least: current volume guidance, current frequency
      guidance, and how they interact. One query cannot cover that.
    - SEARCH IN PARALLEL: issue several search_google calls in ONE round when the
      sub-questions are independent. Never issue the same query twice.
    - THEN READ. Call read_url on the 2–3 best results before stating any specific number,
      date, version, price or recommendation. Reading three pages you already found beats
      running three more searches. read_url takes up to 3 urls in one call — use that.
    - THEN CHECK YOURSELF. This is the step that gets skipped: does what you read answer ALL
      the sub-questions? Do the sources agree? If something is missing or they conflict, run
      another round — search the gap, read the page that settles it. Two to four rounds is
      normal for a real question.
    - STOP when another round would not change the answer. Not before, and not after.
    - CITE what you used: name the publication or domain beside the claim it supports. Never
      present something you did not read as though you read it. Never invent a source, a
      date, or a study.
    - Every research result carries a `next_step` line describing what actually came back.
      Follow it; it is more current than these instructions.
    - FOLLOW-UPS GET THE SAME TREATMENT. "Now do leg day" after a research turn is a new
      question, not a formatting request — re-check whatever could have changed instead of
      answering from what is already in the conversation.
    - If every search fails, say so plainly and answer from general knowledge WITH that
      caveat. Never imply you checked sources you could not reach.
