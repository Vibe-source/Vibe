/// engine's serial queue. That is precisely the `[ChatEngine][MAIN-THREAD-HANG]`
/// shape this migration exists to delete, just pointed at a different thread: the
/// core would stall behind whatever the engine happened to be doing, and a core
/// that blocks on the engine is not an independent pipeline.
///
/// So the key is *pushed*, not pulled. The engine publishes the `SecKey` it has
/// already resolved on its own queue; the core reads it behind an uncontended
/// lock and never waits on anything.

/// key it holds. Storing one here does not put private key material in this

/// cannot: the RSA private key lives in the Keychain as a `SecKey`, and a `SecKey`
/// is a handle to a key the Secure Enclave or the keychain daemon holds. It has no
/// byte representation that could cross an FFI boundary, and giving one to Rust
/// would mean exporting the private key, which is precisely the thing that must
/// never happen.
///
/// So the split is: **Rust decides which wrapped keys to try and in what order;
/// Swift performs the private-key operation; Rust opens the payload.** The private
/// key never leaves this process boundary, and the core never sees it.
///
/// # One call per ingest batch
///
/// A 100-message history page is 100 RSA operations at roughly 0.3–1 ms each on an
/// A18 — 30–100 ms. That happens **once**, on the core's worker thread, and never
/// again for those rows, because the durable store keeps the opened form sealed
/// under the store key. This type must therefore never be called from the main
/// thread, and nothing here dispatches to it.
///
/// # The contract this must not break
///
/// The core pairs answers to requests **positionally**. Returning a different
/// number of slots than it asked for makes every key ambiguous, so the core
/// discards the whole batch. This implementation always appends exactly one slot
/// per request, on every path including failure.
