///
/// # Why this is a separate type
///
/// `VibeSecureSessions` is pure custody — it holds the identity, the store, and
/// the per-chat sessions, and every one of its methods is synchronous and
/// local. Establishment is the opposite: network-bound, retryable, and racy.
/// Keeping them apart means the custody layer stays trivially auditable, and
/// this layer never has to reason about the ratchet.
///
/// # Never on the engine queue
///
/// Every entry point here returns immediately and does its work on
/// `establishmentQueue` / `URLSession`. `ChatEngine`'s serial queue is the
/// engine's critical path, and an HTTP round-trip on it freezes messaging —
/// the same rule that governs every other network call in the engine.
///
/// # The first-contact race
///
/// Two devices can both decide to establish the same chat at the same instant,
/// each creating a group and adding the other. Both then hold a valid session
/// for one chat id, and neither can read the other's messages. The tie-break is
/// in `resolveCollision` below: both sides apply the *same* rule to the *same*
/// two group ids, so they converge without another round-trip.
