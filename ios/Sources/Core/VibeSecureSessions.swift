/// # State is persistent
///
/// Ratchet state lives in a SQLite store on disk (`VibeSecureProvider`), and
/// `chat id -> group id` is remembered so a relaunch reloads the *same* group
/// rather than minting a new one and orphaning everything sealed before the
/// restart. That reload happens lazily in `sessionLocked(chatId:)`, which is why
/// nothing else in this type reads the `sessions` dictionary directly.
///
/// # The send gate
///
/// A `vmls1.` envelope is unreadable to a client that has not shipped this code,
/// so sending was gated while an install base might exist. **Receiving is always
/// on** — it costs nothing when no `vmls1.` arrives, and read-before-write is
/// the state a staged rollout needs every device to pass through first.
///
/// # Establishment lives next door
///
/// Sessions are created and joined by `VibeSecureEstablishment`, which is the
/// only part of MLS that needs the network. This type stays purely local and
/// synchronous so that custody of the ratchet is auditable on its own.
///
/// # Callers must fail closed
///
/// `seal` returning `nil` means *this chat has no session*, and the only safe
/// response is to keep the message queued — never to fall through to the
/// plaintext branch. `ChatEngine` does that by reusing the queue-and-replay
/// path it already had for a missing friend key. A caller that treats `nil` as
/// "send it some other way" silently un-encrypts the conversation, which is the
/// one failure mode this whole layer exists to prevent.
///
/// Groups are not established yet, so `seal` still returns `nil` for them and
/// they continue on their existing path. That is a known gap, tracked in
/// docs/secure-core-architecture.md §4 — not a property of this type.
