/// The SwiftUI list in ``VibeCorePreviewView`` proves the data layer — order,
/// dedup, windowing — by having no geometry code that could be blamed for a
/// wrong answer. This screen is the opposite half: the same core driving
/// `VibeTimelineHost` → `VibeCollectionMessageListHost`, which is a real
/// `UICollectionView` with a real custom layout and real anchor preservation.
/// It is the exact stack P4 points at the production list, aimed somewhere a
/// mistake costs nothing.
///
/// The two counters at the top are the ones that matter:
///
/// - **settled-geometry violations** must be `0`. A non-zero value means a row
///   that was already on screen changed height, which is the month-long bug.
/// - **measured vs reused** shows the frozen-geometry cache working. Sending
///   into a 200-row window should measure ~1 row and reuse the rest; if measured
///   climbs with every send, rows are being re-measured and the freeze is broken.
