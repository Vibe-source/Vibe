/// A throwaway surface that renders **from the Rust core** instead of `ChatEngine`.
///
/// # Why this exists
///
/// P4 points the new render host at the production chat list. That list is
/// ~51,000 lines across six files and owns the commit-first push contract, so a
/// wrong ordering or dedup decision shows up as a visible regression in a real
/// conversation. This screen is the same work aimed somewhere harmless: it
/// exercises the core's **data** layer — ordering, dedup, id healing, deltas,
/// windowing — with no geometry, no anchor preservation, and no production code
/// path involved.
///
/// Deliberately **not** a UICollectionView. Sizing and anchor preservation are
/// where the layout-shift bugs live, and mixing them in here would mean a bug
/// could be either a data bug or a geometry bug with no way to tell them apart.
/// A plain `List` sizes itself; if a row is out of order here, the ordering is
/// wrong, full stop. Geometry gets its own stage on this same screen later.
///
/// # It grades itself
///
/// Reading a list of rows and deciding by eye whether ordering is right is not a
/// test — it is a guess, and it gets harder with every row. So every window the
/// core returns is checked against the invariants in ``VibeCoreInvariantReport``
/// and the verdict is both shown here and written to ``VibeLog`` under the
/// `core` category. An exported log answers "did the core behave" on its own,
/// without the screen and without a description of what was on it.
///
/// Uses Saved-Messages semantics — sealed to self, no peer key to resolve, no
/// network — so it can be driven entirely offline.
