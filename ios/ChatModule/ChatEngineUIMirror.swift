///
/// The engine owns one serial queue, and every UI getter used to hop onto it to
/// read a single dictionary entry. That read costs microseconds; the *wait* does
/// not. A device run on 2026-08-03 measured
/// `[MAIN-THREAD-SYNC-STALL] syncOnQueue blocked main thread for 64ms at
/// agentProgress(chatId:)` — 64 ms of frozen UI to look up one key, because the
/// queue was busy decrypting when the header asked.
///
/// The cost is structural, not incidental: any main-thread reader is exposed to
/// the duration of whatever the queue happens to be running. Making the queue
/// faster narrows the window but never closes it. So the direction inverts — the
/// queue **publishes** and the UI **reads a lock**, and there is nothing left to
/// block on.
///
/// # Freshness
///
/// Published from `postChangeLocked`, the funnel every UI-visible engine
/// mutation already passes through. So the mirror is never staler than the last
/// notification the UI acted on: a reader that woke up because of a change sees
/// the state that caused it.
///
/// A mutation that somehow posts no notification leaves an entry stale rather
/// than wrong, and every field here degrades safely — agent progress expires
/// itself at read time (see ``ChatEngineAgentProgressSnapshot/activePayload(nowMs:)``),
/// typing indicators are re-sent every few seconds by their sender, and presence
/// re-publishes on the next presence event.
///
/// # What does not belong here
///
/// Anything expensive or large. `getChatRows` builds and decrypts a whole
/// transcript; mirroring it would move that cost rather than remove it, and
/// double the memory while doing so. This mirror is for the small, hot, polled
/// reads only.
