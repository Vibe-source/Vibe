/// Which rows can be measured before the push, and how tall they are.

/// # Why this is a gate and not a second implementation
///
/// The first version of this file reimplemented the list's height formulas as pure
/// arithmetic, on the belief that `measureMessageBubbleLayout` was main-thread-bound.
/// **That belief was wrong**, and the audit that produced `docs/row-height-formulas.md`
/// is what disproved it: `ChatListViewCells.swift` contains no `@MainActor`, and every
/// height in it comes from `NSAttributedString.boundingRect` or
/// `NSString.size(withAttributes:)` — CoreText over immutable strings — plus arithmetic.
/// The single exception is `VibeAgentTurnContentView.measuredHeight`, which lays out a
/// real `UIStackView`.
///
/// A parallel implementation would have to agree with the real one to within half a
/// point, forever, across every kind, and a disagreement is not a rounding error — it is
/// a row that changes size after the user can see it. That agreement burden *is* the
/// defect this project exists to remove; `ChatListView` is 22,586 lines partly because
/// heights are decided in more than one place. So this file does not compute heights.
/// It calls the same function the cell calls, and agreement is identity.
///
/// What it adds is the thing that was actually missing: **a decision about which rows may
/// be measured off the main thread**, so a transcript can be measured before it is pushed
/// instead of during. A row measured before the push and never re-measured cannot shift.
///
/// # The one row that cannot
///
/// Agent turns. `VibeAgentTurnContentView.measuredHeight` pins a width constraint on a
/// shared template view, calls `layoutIfNeeded`, then `systemLayoutSizeFitting`, over a
/// stack whose arranged subviews are built in a loop over progress items. It must stay on
/// main. Agent turns therefore move off the *push* rather than off the *thread*: measured
/// at prewarm or at settle, then frozen. At mount time a frozen height and an off-main
/// height are the same thing — a number that already exists.
