/// # The problem this replaces
///
/// `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` recomputes everything on every invalidation. One
/// `setRows` on a 300-row transcript measured 201ms inside `performBatchUpdates`, and
/// that number grows linearly: ~0.65ms per mounted row, so ~600ms at a thousand and
/// seconds at ten thousand. It is paid on every commit, and — because a chat open holds
/// its raster cover until the rows mount — it is also most of the delay between tapping
/// a chat and seeing it.
///
/// That single fact is what made every previous answer a dead end. A bounded window
/// capped the cost by capping the transcript, which the reader felt as a wall. Removing
/// the cap removed the wall and brought the cost back. Neither addressed why mounting a
/// row the layout has already seen should cost anything at all.
///
/// # Why it is O(changed)
///
/// Three properties, and all three are needed:
///
/// 1. **Heights are memoized by row identity, not by index.** Prepending 100 older
///    messages shifts every index by 100; a flow layout re-asks the delegate for all
///    1,100 sizes, this asks for 100. The other thousand are dictionary hits.
/// 2. **Positions are a prefix sum.** One pass of float addition over the height table
///    — microseconds at any transcript size we can hold in memory — rather than a
///    thousand `UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes` allocations.
/// 3. **Attributes are built for the requested rect only.** The offset table is sorted,
///    so the first visible row is a binary search and the rest is a short walk.
///    Roughly twenty objects per query instead of one per row.
///
/// The result is that mounting an entire conversation costs about what mounting one
/// screen of it used to, which is what lets the timeline have no scroll limit without
/// paying for it on every frame.
///
/// # Why every entry point prepares
///
/// A layout that only rebuilds inside `prepare()` is only correct for UIKit, which calls
/// `prepare()` before it reads anything. Everyone else — and this list reads
/// `collectionViewLayout.collectionViewContentSize` directly to decide how much top
/// padding a short transcript needs — gets whatever the last pass happened to leave
/// behind. On a fresh chat that is zero, and the caller concludes the transcript is
/// empty and pads the top by a full screen height. That was the ~950pt of blank
/// wallpaper above the first message, and the jump when it later corrected itself.
///
/// So `ensurePrepared()` guards every read. It is a bool test in the common case.
///
/// # What it deliberately does not do
///
/// It does not measure. Heights come from the delegate, which serves them from the
/// timeline core — already computed off the main thread. Layout here is arithmetic over
/// numbers someone else produced, and keeping it that way is what keeps it fast.
