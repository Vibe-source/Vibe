//! Who a KeyPackage actually belongs to, and how two people check that they
//! agree.
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! Establishment claims a peer's KeyPackage *from the server*. Nothing in MLS
//! makes the server honest: it can serve a KeyPackage it minted itself, sit in
//! the middle of the group, and neither side would notice. Every message would
//! still be genuinely encrypted — to the attacker.
//!
//! Two mechanisms fix that, and both need the same primitive: reading the
//! identity out of a KeyPackage *before* trusting it.
//!
//! * **Pinning (automatic).** Remember the signature key seen the first time,
//!   and refuse to establish if it ever changes. This makes substitution a
//!   one-shot attack that must land on first contact, rather than something
//!   the server can do at any moment.
//! * **Safety numbers (manual).** Derive a short string from both parties'
//!   identity keys. Two people who read it aloud and find it matching know
//!   there is nobody in between. This is what defeats first-contact
//!   substitution, which pinning alone cannot.
//!
//! # Why the safety number lives here
//!
//! It is a pure function of two public keys, so it belongs where it can be
//! tested exhaustively rather than in two platform implementations that must
//! agree forever. Both sides compute the same digits from the same pair, and
//! **order must not matter** — Alice and Bob see the same number without
//! agreeing who is "first". That is the property the tests pin down.
