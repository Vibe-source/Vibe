//! MLS group sessions.
//!
//! A DM is a two-member group — there is no separate 1:1 path here. Every
//! operation below is exactly what a group of two, three, or three thousand
//! members does; the only thing that makes a DM special is that nobody ever
//! calls [`VibeSecureSession::add_members`] a second time.
//!
//! # Commit handling, and what this crate does not yet do
//!
//! [`VibeSecureSession::add_members`] both produces the Commit/Welcome pair
//! *and* merges the commit into the caller's own group state, so the caller
//! who added a member is immediately in the new epoch. What this crate does
//! **not** yet expose is a way for the *other already-present* members to
//! process an incoming Commit and advance in step — that needs an ordered
//! delivery service (see `docs/secure-core-architecture.md` §4, "ordered
//! commit fan-out"), which is server work, not a gap in this API. A new
//! member always joins through [`VibeSecureSession::join_from_welcome`],
//! which needs no Commit at all.
//!
//! # Every call that touches bytes from outside this device is panic-caught
//!
//! OpenMLS 0.8.1 has at least one `debug_assert!` on its ciphertext-AEAD
//! failure path (`private_message_in.rs`, in `PrivateMessageIn::decrypt`) --
//! compiled out in `--release`, but live in `dev`/`test` profiles, where it
//! panics *before* the clean `Err` it was about to construct is returned.
//! Verified directly: a deliberately corrupted `vmls1.` envelope panicked
//! `open()` without a guard, under a plain `cargo test`. This crate's entire
//! job is turning untrusted network bytes into either validated data or an
//! error -- never a crash -- for a stronger reason than tidiness: an unwind
//! that crosses the eventual FFI boundary into Swift is a defined **abort**
//! (Rust has guaranteed this since 1.71, rather than leaving it undefined),
//! and `core/Cargo.toml` states the workspace rule plainly: "never abort: a
//! core panic must degrade to the Swift path, not kill the host." So every
//! call into OpenMLS that processes peer-supplied bytes is panic-guarded,
//! rather than trusting that today's dependency version (or a future one)
//! never panics on adversarial input.
//!
//! That guarding comes in two different strengths, because a caught panic is
//! not always equally safe to walk away from:
//!
//! - [`catch_untrusted`] is for a call that touches **no state that survives
//!   it** -- a constructor that has not yet produced a `Self`, or a
//!   validation step over an owned, local value. A caught panic there is
//!   exactly as safe as the `Result::Err` it stands in for, because there is
//!   nothing left half-mutated for a later call to inherit.
//! - [`VibeSecureSession::with_group`] is for a call that runs with `&mut`
//!   access to this session's live `MlsGroup` -- shared, mutable, ratcheting
//!   state that persists across calls. A caught panic there does not return
//!   the ordinary error; it poisons the session instead. See that method's
//!   doc for why a plain retryable error is the wrong shape for that case.
