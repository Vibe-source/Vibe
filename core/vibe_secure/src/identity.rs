//! Device identity: one Ed25519 signing key plus the MLS `BasicCredential`

//!
//! Vibe already puts one asymmetric key per *account* in the Keychain; MLS
//! makes the identity per-*device* instead, which is what finally makes
//! multi-device native instead of "one key smuggled to a second phone." The
//! device id is deliberately the thing a future safety-number UI hashes, so
//! it is threaded through unchanged into the `BasicCredential` rather than
//! derived from key material — the credential is what a peer actually sees.
