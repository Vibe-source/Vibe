//! Group end-to-end encryption: per-epoch symmetric keys.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Groups and channels ship **in the clear** today. `ChatEngine.swift:4510` puts
//! the payload JSON straight into `encrypted_content` when `isGroup`, and the
//! server stores that string verbatim (`chat_channel.ex:144`). There is no group
//! key anywhere in the iOS client, the web client, or the server. This module is
//! the first half of closing that gap — the deterministic, testable half that
//! belongs in one implementation rather than three.
//!
//! # The design, and why not the alternatives
//!
//! A group has a monotone sequence of [`VibeGroupEpoch`]s. Each epoch owns one
//! symmetric AES-256 key, held by exactly the members of that epoch. A message
//! is sealed under the epoch key current at send time and records its epoch, so
//! a member who joined at epoch 5 can still open epoch 3 history *if and only
//! if* they were given the epoch 3 key.
//!
//! Membership changes mint a new epoch. That is what makes removal meaningful:
//! a removed member keeps whatever epoch keys they already had — you cannot
//! un-read history they could already read — but never receives the next one,
//! so they are cryptographically excluded from everything after their removal.
//!
//! Distributing an epoch key to a member is **not this module's job**. It rides
//! the existing 1:1 hybrid envelope, which is already end-to-end encrypted and
//! already works. That is the whole reason this design is small: the hard part
//! (per-member key agreement) is a solved problem in this codebase, and groups
//! reduce to "ship one symmetric key over a channel that already works".
//!
//! Rejected, and why:
//!
//! * **Per-message RSA wrap to every member.** `encrypted_content` is a single
//!   column shared by every reader, so there is nowhere to put N per-recipient
//!   blobs without a schema change and an N-way fan-out on every send.
//! * **Sender keys (the Signal/WhatsApp model).** Strictly better — it adds
//!   forward secrecy — but it needs a per-sender ratchet, persisted ratchet
//!   state that survives reinstall, and a skipped-message key cache for
//!   out-of-order delivery. Epoch keys are a clean subset: the ratchet can be
//!   added later *inside* an epoch without changing the envelope or the stored
//!   history, because the epoch id already tells a reader which regime applies.
//! * **MLS (RFC 9420).** The right long-term answer for large groups, and far
//!   too large a dependency and migration to bundle into a rendering refactor.
//!
//! # The wire format, and why it is a new one
//!
//! ```text
//! vgrp2.<b64(epoch, 4 bytes LE)>.<b64(12-byte IV)>.<b64(ciphertext || 16-byte tag)>
//! ```
//!
//! Prefix-detected, exactly like the agent runtime's `arte1.` and the media
//! format's `vmed2`. It is deliberately **not** an overload of the hybrid
//! `{v,iv,c,k}` envelope:
//!
//! * the shipped classifier requires `iv`+`c`+`k` before it will treat a string
//!   as hybrid (`envelope::classify`), and a group envelope has no per-recipient
//!   `k` slot to offer;
//! * a deployed client that meets an unrecognised **prefix** renders it as
//!   literal text — visibly wrong, obviously "update your app". A deployed
//!   client that meets a hybrid envelope it cannot open renders base64 garbage
//!   or an empty bubble. Failing loudly is the better failure.
//!
//! The reserved `g` slot in the hybrid envelope stays exactly as it is: parsed,
//! never written. This module does not touch it.
//!
//! # Rollout is gated, and the gate is a type
//!
//! Turning group encryption on before every member's client understands it does
//! not degrade the group — it **splits** it, silently, into members who can read
//! and members who cannot. So [`seal_group`] cannot be called without a
//! [`VibeGroupSealAuthorization`], which cannot be constructed unless every
//! member is known to be capable. The gate is a compile-time visible fact rather
//! than a paragraph in a document, the same discipline `media::seal_stream2`
//! uses for the deferred `vmed2` format.
