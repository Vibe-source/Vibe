//! FFI boundary for [`vibe_secure`], the MLS session layer.
//!
//! # Status: linked and callable, deliberately not yet wired into messaging
//!
//! This module exists so the MLS crate is compiled into the XCFramework and
//! reachable from Swift. It is **not** yet on the send/receive path, and it must
//! not be put there until two things exist that do not exist today:
//!
//! * **Server-side KeyPackage distribution.** A device cannot be added to a
//!   group until its KeyPackage can be published and fetched. Until then
//!   [`VibeSecureIdentityHandle::key_package`] produces bytes with nowhere to go.
//! * **Persistent group state.** The provider here is
//!   `OpenMlsRustCrypto::default()`, which keeps ratchet state **in memory
//!   only**. A session created through this API does not survive app restart, so
//!   sealing real user messages under it would lose history at the next launch.
//!   The durable answer is OpenMLS's `StorageProvider` implemented over
//!   `vibe_core_store`'s sealed SQLite — see docs/secure-core-architecture.md §4.
//!
//! Both limitations are stated here rather than in a ticket because this is the
//! file someone will reach for when they want to "just start using MLS".
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! `VibeSecureSession`'s methods take `&mut self`; a uniffi object is shared as
//! `Arc<Self>` and its methods take `&self`. The session is therefore behind a
//! `Mutex`. A poisoned lock is reported as [`VibeFfiError::Internal`] rather than
//! unwrapped — the crate's whole posture is that a panic degrades, never aborts.

/// connection genuinely cannot be used concurrently, and MLS operations mutate
