## 1. Verified Current Implementation & Status

The following statements reflect the verified state of Vibe's shipping cryptography and security implementation (verified August 2026). They take precedence over historical target material:

- **1:1 DM Message Bodies**: A 1:1 message send with a resolved peer public key uses a fresh 256-bit AES key and 96-bit nonce with AES-256-GCM. The AES key is wrapped for the recipient (and sender, when available) using static **RSA-2048-OAEP-SHA-256**.
- **No Forward Secrecy or Post-Compromise Security**: Because message keys are delivered wrapped under a static RSA-2048 key, compromising the long-term private RSA key exposes past message history. Key derivation is not ratcheted in the legacy protocol.
- **Groups and Channels**: **Not currently end-to-end encrypted.** When sending in groups or channels (`isGroup` is true), message JSON is written directly in plaintext to `encrypted_content`.
- **Fallback / Unresolved Keys**: A 1:1 or agent path lacking a resolved peer public key falls back to sending plaintext JSON. "The server never sees plaintext" is not a product-wide claim today.
- **Known Plaintext Leaks (Fixes In Progress — Phase 0 / Run `securecore-0806`)**:
  - `pushPreview`: Historical implementation sent up to 160 characters of message text in cleartext outside the envelope. In run `securecore-0806` (Phase 0), `pushPreview` is removed on 1:1 E2E DM paths and replaced with content-free notifications (`pushKind`).
  - `mediaKey`: Media files are AES-256-GCM encrypted, but the `mediaKey` was historically transmitted in cleartext on the wire payload and inside metadata (`ios/ChatModule/ChatEngine.swift`), stored at a public Supabase URL (`server/lib/vibe/supabase_storage.ex`). Run `securecore-0806` (Phase 0) removes `mediaKey` from the outer wire payload and metadata, keeping it strictly inside the sealed envelope.
  - Auth Secret Split: Account passwords historically derived key-wrapping passphrases in a manner where the server held both credentials at login. Run `securecore-0806` (Phase 0) splits the authentication secret (`authSecret = HKDF(recovery, "vibe/auth/v1")`) from key wrapping (`kek = PBKDF2(recovery, "vibe/kek/v1")`).
  - Message Length Padding: Historical messages leaked exact length; Phase 0 introduces `vibe_pad` length bucket padding (256, 1024, 4096, 16384, 65536 bytes).
- **Local History Encryption**: The iOS SQLite history cache (`payload` BLOB) is sealed at rest using AES-256-GCM and row-bound AAD (`core/vibe_core/src/store_seal.rs`), keyed from Keychain (`VibeCoreStoreKey.swift`). If Keychain access fails, it logs and fails open to plaintext.
- **Media Format**: Existing encrypted media uses whole-file AES-256-GCM. Authentication is completed only when the final tag is verified (not authenticated streaming).

Until migration qualification gates pass and independent third-party audits complete:
- Describe E2E support per chat class, not as an app-wide guarantee.
- Do not claim zero knowledge, sealed local history, completed cryptographic audit, screenshot prevention, or regulatory compliance.
- Treat security telemetry as metadata-only (never log keys, plaintext, media keys, or notification bodies).

## 2. Target Architecture: Messaging Layer Security (MLS)

As detailed in [docs/secure-core-architecture.md](secure-core-architecture.md), Vibe is migrating its end-to-end encryption core from static RSA-2048-OAEP to **Messaging Layer Security (MLS, RFC 9420)** via OpenMLS (`openmls` 0.8) in a new sibling crate, `core/vibe_secure`.

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Unified Protocol (DM as a 2-Member Group)**: 1:1 direct messages and group chats share a single protocol state machine. A 1:1 DM is treated as a two-member MLS group.
- **Ratchets**:
  - **Symmetric Ratchet (Forward Secrecy)**: Message keys are derived via one-way KDF per step and immediately deleted.
  - **DH Ratchet (Post-Compromise Security)**: Directional turns mix fresh ephemeral X25519 DH keys into the root key schedule, healing sessions automatically after compromise.
- **Envelope Format**: MLS messages use format `MlsV2`, identified by the `"vmls1."` prefix (`VIBE_MLS_SEALED_PREFIX`). Legacy `v1` message history remains readable.
- **Ciphersuite**: `MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519` (pinned OpenMLS 0.8 dependencies).
- **Crate Separation**: `vibe_secure` is kept strictly decoupled from `vibe_core` to preserve deterministic testing of timeline logic.

### Phased Roadmap Summary

- **Phase 0 — Stop the Bleeding (In Progress / Run `securecore-0806`)**:
  - Remove `pushPreview` on 1:1 DMs (content-free push notifications).
  - Auth secret split (`authSecret` vs `kek`).
  - Strip cleartext `mediaKey` from wire.
  - Add message length padding (`vibe_pad`).
- **Phase 1 — Identity (Planned)**:
  - Per-device Ed25519 identity key in Keychain, TOFU key pinning, UI safety numbers, signed envelopes.
- **Phase 2 — MLS in Core (Planned)**:
  - OpenMLS 0.8 integration in `core/vibe_secure`, group state in sealed SQLite store (`vibe_core_store`), `vmls1.` (`MlsV2`) envelopes for 1:1 DMs.
- **Phase 3 — Groups Migration (Planned)**:
  - Migrate group chats and channels to MLS sessions; retire plaintext group path.
- **Phase 4 — Metadata & Media Hardening (Planned)**:
  - Sealed sender (M3), encrypted group roster (M4), `vmed2` segmented AEAD streaming media, server blob expiry.
- **Phase 5 — Post-Quantum Cryptography (Planned)**:
  - X25519 + ML-KEM-768 hybrid ciphersuite via `libcrux-ml-kem` / `ml-kem`.

## 3. Legacy Target Design (Historical Context)

> **Note:** The TweetNaCl / XSalsa20-Poly1305 description below is historical target documentation. It does not reflect either the shipping static RSA-OAEP + AES-GCM implementation or the target MLS (RFC 9420) architecture described in [docs/secure-core-architecture.md](secure-core-architecture.md).

### Message Encryption (Historical TweetNaCl Design)
- **Algorithm**: TweetNaCl Box (XSalsa20, Poly1305, Curve25519)
- **Status**: Historical specification; replaced by static RSA-2048-OAEP + AES-256-GCM today, migrating to MLS (RFC 9420) in Phase 2.

### Key Management
- **Derivation**: Account password → Argon2 / PBKDF2 (Phase 0 splits KEK from auth secret).
- **Storage**:
  - **iOS**: Keychain (hardware-backed when available)
  - **Android**: Android Keystore (hardware-backed when available)
  - **Web**: IndexedDB with encryption layer
  - **Server**: Never stores user private keys

### File Encryption
- **Current Implementation**: Whole-file AES-256-GCM. Cleartext `mediaKey` on wire payload is removed in Phase 0.
- **Target (Phase 4)**: `vmed2` segmented AEAD streaming media with per-attachment keys and unguessable URLs.

## Authentication

### Session Management

**JWT Tokens**:
- Access token: 15 minutes validity
- Refresh token: 7 days validity
- Automatic rotation on refresh
- Secure, HttpOnly cookies

**Flow**:
```
1. User login with email + password
2. Server verifies credentials (bcrypt + Argon2)
3. Issues JWT access + refresh tokens
4. Client stores tokens securely
5. Each request includes access token
6. Expired? Use refresh token to get new access token
7. Refresh token expired? Re-authenticate
```

### Password Security

- **Hashing**: bcrypt + Argon2 (double hashing)
- **Minimum**: 12 characters
- **Validation**: Server enforces NIST guidelines
- **Reset**: Email-based verification link (1 hour validity)
- **2FA**: Optional TOTP support

---

## Transport Security

### HTTPS/TLS

- **Minimum Version**: TLS 1.3
- **Certificates**: Let's Encrypt or CA-signed
- **HSTS**: Enabled (1 year)
- **Certificate Pinning**: Optional (iOS/Android)

### Certificate Validation

## Optional Privacy Features

### Tor Integration

Connect via Tor for network-level anonymity:

```bash

TOR_SOCKS_PORT=9050
```

**Benefits**:
- Hide IP address
- Bypass regional blocks
- Prevent ISP monitoring
- Protect against traffic analysis

**Trade-offs**:
- Slower connection (2-3x latency)
- Some features may be limited

### Ephemeral Messages

Messages that auto-delete:
- Duration: User-configurable (5s to 24h)
- Server: Deletes after expiry
- Client: Clears from memory
- Screenshot prevention: Planned (not currently guaranteed)

# Fail2ban for attack prevention
# SELinux or AppArmor enabled
```
